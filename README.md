# Palworld Archipelago Randomizer

An [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multiworld randomizer for Palworld. It is playable and being playtested; the
World Tree goal and alpha checks are not tested in game yet.

Palworld's Technology tree (levels 2 and up) becomes an Archipelago shop whose cards show what each purchase sends to
the multiworld, with captures, alphas, towers, fast-travel points and levels as further checks and Area Passes gating
progression. It runs as a UE4SS mod inside the player's own game: a Lua core plus a C++ part that connects to the
Archipelago server. Targets Palworld 1.0.5 and Archipelago 0.6.8. To install and connect, follow the setup guide,
`apworld/palworld/docs/setup_en.md` (also the Setup Guide on an Archipelago site's Palworld page).

`apworld/palworld/` is the APWorld: options, items, locations and logic, with `game_data.py` generated from the game's
tables by `tools/gen_apworld_data.py`. `mod/PalworldArchipelago/` is the UE4SS Lua mod (its `Scripts/ap_data.lua` is
generated from the APWorld by `tools/gen_lua_data.py`), and `mod/test/` its test harness (`tools/lua_harness.sh`).
`cppmod/APConnector/` is the UE4SS C++ mod that connects to the Archipelago server; CI builds it on Windows and
packages it with the Lua mod.

`mod/PERF-PROBE.md` explains the test builds' performance probe (`perf_log=1`) and how to read its log lines.
`logicmod/` holds the optional PalworldArchipelagoUI Blueprint pak (the Archipelago Mailbox's own window), built in
the community Palworld Modding Kit; its README has the steps. `spike/` holds the feasibility probes (a server-side probe and the client tech-shop probe). `tools/` reads Palworld's
own data through the probe and turns it into the facts the randomizer needs; `data/` holds those facts (areas, where
each Pal can be obtained). Raw dumps of Pocketpair's game tables are not distributed here: they are Pocketpair's, not
covered by this repository's licence, and are regenerated from your own copy of the game with the probe's
`dumptable` and `dumpactors` commands.

Most of its code, tools and documentation are written by Claude, an AI model made by Anthropic, at JustEyeTee's
direction.

## Options page

`docs/options/` is a page where a player picks the Palworld options (or a preset) and downloads a player YAML for
Archipelago. Archipelago's website only has options pages for the worlds it ships, so this world has its own. Once
GitHub Pages serves the `docs` folder of `main`, it is at
https://justeyetee.github.io/Palworld-Archipelago-Randomizer/options/. The YAML it writes is the one Archipelago's
template generator writes for the same choices.

Its YAML (like Archipelago's templates) requires the world's version, so the host's `.apworld` must be built with
`tools/build_apworld.py`, which adds the manifest fields Archipelago reads the version from:

    AP_DIR=../archipelago-0.6.8 ../archipelago-0.6.8/.venv/bin/python tools/build_apworld.py palworld.apworld

A plain zip of `apworld/palworld` loads as version 0.0.0 and Archipelago refuses the page's files. The test scripts
build their `.apworld` with it too.

The page reads `docs/options/options.json`, which is written from the APWorld's options, groups and presets. After
changing `apworld/palworld/options.py` (or the world version), regenerate it with the Archipelago venv:

    AP_DIR=../archipelago-0.6.8 ../archipelago-0.6.8/.venv/bin/python tools/gen_options_page.py

`tools/test_options_page.py` checks that `options.json` is current, that the page's YAML for the defaults and each
preset is the same as Archipelago's own templates, and that each one generates a beatable seed (its docstring has
the command; it runs the page's JavaScript in QuickJS, from the `quickjs` pip package). To try the page locally,
serve the folder (`python3 -m http.server -d docs`) and open http://localhost:8000/options/.

Montoreano, under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`art/FONT-LICENSE-LilitaOne-OFL.txt`); the options page ships the
font file itself (`docs/options/LilitaOne-Regular.ttf`, with its licence in `docs/options/LilitaOne-OFL.txt`). The
README graphics in `art/readme/` and the options page's header and styling were made by Claude (Opus 5.5) too.
