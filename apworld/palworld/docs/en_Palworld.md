# Palworld

Palworld's Technology tree (levels 2 and up) becomes a shop: each card shows what buying it sends to the multiworld,
and every tech is an item that arrives from Archipelago. New areas open with Area Passes. Captures, alphas,
fast-travel points, levels and towers are further checks.

## Goals

- **Towers** (default): beat a number of tower bosses. Any towers count, but the logic plans for the first ones in the
  game's order: Zoe (level 10), Lily (20), Axel (30), Marcus (40), Victor (50), Saya (55), Bjorn (60), Auri (68).
- **Relic Hunt**: collect Palpagos Relics, shuffled across the whole multiworld.
- **Paldeck**: register a number of different Pals (catch or hatch them).
- **World Tree**: beat the boss at the top of the World Tree, the end of the game. Untested in game so far.

## How many checks

Checks stop at a level that fits the goal (the Check Level Cap, automatic by default): 8 levels past the last tower
boss you need (18 for one tower, 28 for two), 5 levels past the level by which you can register enough Pals, 30 for a Relic Hunt, or no limit for the
World Tree. Shop slots for techs above it stay normal research. Ready-made presets (approximate check counts; a typical Archipelago
game has about 180):

| Preset | Goal | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Short Sync | 1 tower, level checks every 5 (5, 10, 15), no fast-travel checks | ~180 |
| Sync | 1 tower | ~240 |
| Long Sync | 2 towers | ~390 |
| Relic Hunt Sync | 15 of 20 relics, checks up to level 25 | ~355 |
| Paldeck Sync | 60 Pals | ~250 |
| Async | 3 towers | ~585 |
| Full Game Async | World Tree | ~1,150 |

With Area Locks on, a short goal keeps a small map: areas whose Pals are all above the cap have no pass and no checks,
and their walls stay up (Areas Beyond the Goal: locked, the default). A two-tower game has passes for the areas up to
level 28 only. Areas Beyond the Goal can instead open them from the start (still with no checks in them), or keep a
pass for every area as before.

Shop slots cost their usual tech points. Long goals ask for more points than levelling gives: Technical Manuals from
dungeons, treasure chests and the Bounty shop make up the rest.

Alpha checks are untested in game so far: if beating an alpha sends nothing, turn Alpha Checks off for your next
game.

## What the logic expects

Levels climb area by area: an area counts for levelling once it is open and you are no more than 8 levels below its
Pals. Nothing stops you levelling; the logic just won't expect a level-20 boss or a level-23 Pal before your open areas
let you reach that level.

By default (Gear Logic off) only Area Passes and levels decide where things can be. Your first Pal Sphere comes early,
and gear never holds up progression: better spheres, furnaces, prerequisites, the Pal Labor Research Lab and breeding
are ordinary items. Tech cards that need another tech or Lab research first stay normal research, bred-only Pals
aren't checks, and parts of the map only the open sea reaches have no checks. A saddle counts only where the map needs
one: a flying mount for the Sky Islands, and a swimming or flying one when the goal lies across the open sea.

With Gear Logic on, the logic also asks for spheres good enough for each Pal's level (and the furnace their recipe
needs), every tech's prerequisites, the Lab, breeding, and a mount for the open sea.

Tech slots cost their usual tech points, which the logic doesn't count. So only the slots levelling pays for in time
(6 points a level, the cheapest first as they open; Ancient slots within the Ancient points of the towers you beat before
the goal) can hold anyone's progression or useful items; the rest hold filler and traps. Fast-travel points and
Technical Manuals give the spare points for those.

Filler items are material bundles (Wood, Stone, Paldium, Ingot, Sphere, Food); the Tech Point Items option adds
Tech Points +2 and Ancient Tech Points +1.

By default the décor techs (furniture, flag and foliage sets, statues, signs and lights) stay normal research, bought
with tech points as usual; the Tech Checks option can make them checks too.

Items you receive (material bundles and the like) wait in your Archipelago Mailbox until you take them, so nothing
lands in your bag mid-fight. Open it from the Esc menu's Archipelago Mailbox button, or from the one at the right
of your name on the Inventory page (new, not yet tried in game); it has no size limit.

## Traps

Off by default. Trap Chance replaces that share of the filler items (bundles and tech points) with traps, picked by
the trap weights. None of them can make you faint:

- **Slow Trap**: half walking speed for a minute.
- **Hunger Trap**: your stomach loses half a full meter of satiety, but never drops below a quarter (so it never starts starving damage).
- **Teleport Trap**: back to the starting area. It waits while you are in a dungeon.
- **Fool Trap**: an alarming notice, then "just kidding" a few seconds later. Nothing happens.

Traps arrive at most one every 15 seconds, and wait while you are fainted, while the world is loading and while the
mailbox is open. A chat line names each trap and who sent it. Traps are untested in game so far: if one can't do its
job, chat says "<trap> fizzled" and nothing else happens.

## Death Link

With Death Link on, fainting sends a death to everyone linked, and a death from them faints you (through the game's
own faint). Death Link Amnesty forgives that many of your own faints before one is sent: with 2, every third faint is
sent. Chat says when a faint is forgiven and how many are left. The count is kept with the seed's save, so quitting
doesn't reset it. Deaths other players send you never count. Amnesty is untested in game so far.
