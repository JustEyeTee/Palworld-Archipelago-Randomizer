# PalworldArchipelagoUI (LogicMod)

An optional Blueprint pak that gives the Archipelago Mailbox its own window:
- one row per item; pick a row to take that item into your bag;
- Take all and Close buttons;
- mouse, keyboard and controller all work.

Without it, the Lua mod shows the mailbox in the game's own chest window, which works on its own. The pak holds only
layout. All logic stays in the Lua mod (`Scripts/mailbox.lua`), so the pak rarely needs rebuilding.

It is built in the community Palworld Modding Kit (Unreal Engine 5.1) on Windows. A Linux machine can't build it: the
kit needs Windows tools.

## What the Lua mod expects (keep these names exactly)

| Asset (`/Game/Mods/PalworldArchipelagoUI/`) | Parent | Widgets (each ticked **Is Variable**) | Graph |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ModActor` | Actor | none | none |
| `WBP_APButton` | User Widget | `Btn` (Button), `Icon` (Image), `Label` (Text) | custom event `AP_Clicked`, called from Btn's On Clicked |
| `WBP_APMailbox` | PalUserWidgetOverlayUI | `Title`, `Summary` (Text), `List` (Scroll Box), `TakeAll`, `Close` (WBP_APButton) | none |

The pak file must be named `PalworldArchipelagoUI.pak`, the same as the folder.

How the Lua mod uses it:
- It opens the window through the game's HUD and fills `List` with WBP_APButton rows.
- It hooks `WBP_APButton_C:AP_Clicked` to learn which row or button was pressed.
- If a name above is missing, UE4SS.log says `mailbox: the LogicMod window has no widget named ...`.

## Part 1: one-time PC setup (about 1 to 2 hours, mostly downloads)

1. Install the **Epic Games Launcher**, sign in, and install **Unreal Engine 5.1** (Library > Engine Versions > +).
2. Install **Visual Studio 2022** with the "Game development with C++" workload, plus the individual component
   **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.38)**.
3. Install the **.NET 6 SDK**.
4. Install the **Audiokinetic Launcher** (needs a free Audiokinetic account). Through it, install
   **Wwise 2021.1.11.7933** with the SDK, and download the offline integration files for Unreal.
5. Clone the kit next to a short path: `git clone https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit C:\PMK`.
6. Put Wwise into the kit:
   1. Unpack `Unreal.5.0.tar.xz` from the Wwise offline files. It may hold a second `.tar` to unpack.
   2. Copy the unpacked `Wwise` folder to `C:\PMK\Plugins\Wwise`.
   3. Make `C:\PMK\Plugins\Wwise\ThirdParty`.
   4. Copy `Win32_vc170`, `x64_vc170` and `include` into it from
      `C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2021.1.11.7933\SDK`.
   5. Copy `Win32_vc170` and `x64_vc170` again, naming the copies `Win32_vc160` and `x64_vc160`.
   6. In `C:\PMK\Plugins\Wwise\Wwise.uplugin`, change `"EngineVersion" : "5.0.0"` to `"EngineVersion" : "5.1"`.
7. Start Unreal Engine 5.1 once and close it. Then edit
   `%APPDATA%\Unreal Engine\UnrealBuildTool\BuildConfiguration.xml`:
   - under `VCProjectFileGenerator`: `<Version>VisualStudio2022</Version>`;
   - under `WindowsPlatform`: `<Compiler>VisualStudio2022</Compiler>`, `<CompilerVersion>14.38.33130</CompilerVersion>`
     and `<ToolchainVersion>14.38.33130</ToolchainVersion>`.
8. Double-click `C:\PMK\Pal.uproject`.
   - Answer **Yes** to "modules are out of date". The first compile takes a while.
   - Answer **Yes** to any Wwise compatibility prompt, and close any Wwise project-path popup.
   - Once the editor is up, let shaders finish, close it and open it once more.

Steps 1, 2 and 4 need your sign-ins. The PC Claude session can do steps 3 and 5 to 7 for you.

## Part 2: make the assets (a minute)

In the kit's editor, choose **Tools > Execute Python Script...** and pick `logicmod\make_assets.py` from this repo.

Or have the PC session run it with the editor closed:

```
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.1\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe" C:\PMK\Pal.uproject -run=pythonscript -script="<repo>\logicmod\make_assets.py"
```

What it does:
- It makes the folder `Content/Mods/PalworldArchipelagoUI`, the three Blueprints and the chunk label (chunk 1, always
  cooked).
- It ticks the window's **Is Enable Cancel Action**, so Esc or a controller's B closes it.
- The Output Log lists each step with a `[PalworldArchipelagoUI]` prefix.

## Part 3: by hand in the editor (about 15 minutes)

Unreal's Python can't lay out widgets or add graph nodes, so these steps are manual. After renaming a widget, tick
**Is Variable** at the top of its Details panel. Text widgets start with it off.

**WBP_APButton** (one row of the list, and the two buttons at the bottom):
1. Open it. From the Palette, drag a **Button** into the Hierarchy and rename it `Btn`.
2. Drag a **Horizontal Box** onto `Btn`.
3. Drag an **Image** into the Horizontal Box and rename it `Icon`.
   - Brush > Image Size: 40 x 40.
   - Visibility: Collapsed. The mod shows it when it has an icon.
   - Slot padding: right 12, vertical alignment centre.
4. Drag a **Text** into the Horizontal Box and rename it `Label`.
   - Font size 20, vertical alignment centre.
   - Slot Size: Fill.
5. Open the **Graph** tab. Right-click > **Add Custom Event** and name it `AP_Clicked`. Leave it with nothing connected.
6. Back in **Designer**, select `Btn`, and under Details > Events click **+** next to **On Clicked**.
7. From that new node's white output pin, drag out, type `AP_Clicked` and choose the function call.
8. **Compile**, then **Save**.

**WBP_APMailbox** (the window):
1. Open it. Drag a **Canvas Panel** into the Hierarchy as its root.
2. Drag a **Border** into the Canvas Panel. In its Slot:
   - Anchors: centre;
   - Alignment: 0.5, 0.5;
   - Position: 0, 0;
   - Size: 760 x 620.
   Set Brush Color to a dark blue-grey at about 90% alpha, and Padding to 24.
3. Drag a **Vertical Box** into the Border. Into the Vertical Box, in this order:
   1. a **Text** named `Title`, font size 28;
   2. a **Text** named `Summary`, font size 16, Auto Wrap Text on, slot padding bottom 12;
   3. a **Scroll Box** named `List`, slot Size Fill;
   4. a **Horizontal Box**, slot padding top 12 and horizontal alignment right.
4. From the Palette's **User Created** section, drag two **WBP_APButton** into that Horizontal Box. Name them
   `TakeAll` and `Close`, and give `Close` a left padding of 12.
5. Check that `Title`, `Summary`, `List`, `TakeAll` and `Close` all have **Is Variable** ticked.
6. In **Class Defaults**, check that **Is Enable Cancel Action** is ticked. Part 2 sets it; tick it if not.
7. **Compile**, then **Save**.

## Part 4: package and install

1. Open **Edit > Project Settings > Packaging** and turn on **Use Pak File** and **Generate Chunks**.
2. Choose **Platforms > Windows > Package Project** and pick an output folder, for example
   `C:\AI\CLAUDE\palworld-logicmod\out`.
3. In `out\Windows\Pal\Content\Paks\`, take `pakchunk1-Windows.pak`. If `pakchunk1-Windows.ucas` and `.utoc` sit
   beside it, take those too.
4. Rename them to `PalworldArchipelagoUI.pak` (and `.ucas` / `.utoc`).
5. Copy them to
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Content\Paks\LogicMods\`.
   Make the `LogicMods` folder if it isn't there.
6. Make sure `BPModLoaderMod` is enabled in `ue4ss\Mods\mods.txt`. UE4SS ships it on.
7. In game, open Esc > **Archipelago Mailbox**. UE4SS.log should say `mailbox: window open`. If it says
   `chest view open` instead, the pak wasn't found.

To go back to the chest window without removing the pak, set `mailbox_view=chest` in the mod's `config.txt`.

## Later, only if needed

- **Giving Pals:** no Lua route works. Two crashed the game in the v0.11.3 playtest (drop and pick up, and the
  character manager: UE4SS can't pass a Pal's save parameter struct from Lua); the captured cage makes a Pal handle
  but never a Pal in the world, so nothing can be captured (v0.11.3, v0.11.4). The C++ connector now has a try at
  it: `AP_GivePal` (cppmod/APConnector/src/pal_gift.cpp) builds the save data and calls `CreateIndividual` with the
  party's own callback bound, or imports the Pal into the Palbox, in heap memory of the right size. **It is untested in
  game and unbuilt until CI runs**; `test_tools=1` gives one hotkey per route (Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+5, see
  `Scripts/test_tools.lua`). Like the game's own create, it works only where the game has authority: single player or
  a listen-server host, not a client of a dedicated server. A Blueprint function here remains the fallback if every
  route fails: it can build the save parameter itself and call `CreateIndividual` with a real callback.
- **Wall look:** done as its own pak; see "The wall material" below.

## The wall material (PalworldArchipelagoArt.pak)

A second, separate pak with one material, `M_APWall`, for multicoloured area walls. The game's wall material shows one
colour per wall piece. This one shows a full-colour picture. It is independent of the mailbox window: it needs only
Part 1's setup, not Parts 2 and 3.

1. Run `logicmod\make_wall_material.py` the same way as Part 2 (Tools > Execute Python Script..., or the
   `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe ... -run=pythonscript` line with this script). It builds the whole material and its chunk
   label (chunk 2); nothing is by hand. The Output Log lines start with `[PalworldArchipelagoArt]`.
2. Optional check: open `Content/Mods/PalworldArchipelagoArt/M_APWall` and look for a compile error at the bottom.
3. Package as in Part 4 (Use Pak File and Generate Chunks on). Take `pakchunk2-Windows.pak` (and `.ucas` / `.utoc`
   if there), rename to `PalworldArchipelagoArt.pak` (and `.ucas` / `.utoc`), and copy to `Pal\Content\Paks\LogicMods\`.
4. In game with `test_tools=1`, Ctrl+F3 to a `colour-...` skin. UE4SS.log says `wall skin colour-...: material made on
   M_APWall`. Without the pak it says `needs the PalworldArchipelagoArt pak` and Ctrl+F3 skips it.

What the Lua mod sets on it: `Pattern` (the RGBA tile from `walls\ap-wall-colour-<name>.png`), and optionally
`CellSize` (cm per tile, 300), `ScrollU`/`ScrollV`, `Tint`, `Brightness`, `NightDim`, `Opacity`, `FadeStart`/`FadeEnd`
(900 / 1500 cm). The pattern is laid on the wall in world space, so it keeps its size on every piece and recedes in
perspective.
